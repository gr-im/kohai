The aim of the project is to re-implement the
[timetracker](https://github.com/xvw/planet/tree/master/src/bin/log)
buried in [Planet](https://github.com/xvw/planet) (_RIP_), however,
the **real** objective is to, once again, _reinvent the wheel_ because
it's great fun to try out encodings in a project that may never see
the light of day! _Muehe_.
