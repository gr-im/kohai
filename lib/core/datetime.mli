(** A type describing a datetime. *)

  }

(** An amount for operation on dates. *)
type op

(** {1 Building dates} *)

(** [make ?time ~year ~month ~day ()] build a date with a lot of
    validation. *)
val make

  -> year:int
  -> month:month
  -> day:int
  -> unit

(** {2 Constants} *)

(** [unix] return a datetime object for [1970:01:01T00:00:00]. *)
val unix : t

(** {1 Date information} *)

(** Returns the day of week of a given datetime. (the Algorithm is
    pretty naÃ¯ve) *)
val day_of_week : t -> day_of_week

(** Return the number of days in the given month. *)
val days_in_month : t -> int

(** {1 Date manipulation} *)

(** compute a new date at the begining of the day. *)
val begin_of_day : t -> t

(** compute a new date at the end of the day. *)
val end_of_day : t -> t

(** compute a new date at the begining of the week. *)
val begin_of_week : t -> t

(** compute a new date at the end of the week. *)
val end_of_week : t -> t

(** compute a new date at the begining of the month. *)
val begin_of_month : t -> t

(** compute a new date at the end of the month. *)
val end_of_month : t -> t

(** compute a new date at the begining of the year. *)
val begin_of_year : t -> t

(** compute a new date at the end of the year. *)
val end_of_year : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the next year. *)
val succ_year : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the previous year. *)
val pred_year : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the next month. *)
val succ_month : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the previous month. *)
val pred_month : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the next week. *)
val succ_week : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the previous week. *)
val pred_week : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the next day. *)
val succ_day : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the previous day. *)
val pred_day : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the next hour. *)
val succ_hour : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the previous hour. *)
val pred_hour : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the next min. *)
val succ_min : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the previous min. *)
val pred_min : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the next sec. *)
val succ_sec : t -> t

(** compute a date at the begining of the previous sec. *)
val pred_sec : t -> t

(** {2 Basic arithmetic}

    Arithmetic operations are a bit greedy, as they loop over the
    various succ and pred operations. But the aim is essentially to
    perform small operations. *)

(** [add op dt] perform the operation on [dt]. i.e: [add (day 3) dt]. *)
val add : op -> t -> t

val min : int -> op
val sec : int -> op
val hour : int -> op
val day : int -> op
val week : int -> op
val month : int -> op
val year : int -> op
